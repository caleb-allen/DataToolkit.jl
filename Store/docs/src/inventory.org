#+title: The Inventory

The store needs a way of keeping track of which data sources are actively being
used, and which are orphaned. To do this, we need to keep track of two things:
1. The data sources being stored
2. The data collections using those data sources

Essentially we need a "stock list" for our data sources, or a "data inventory",
and this is what the =Inventory.toml= file functions as.

* Format of the Inventory file
The inventory file needs to contain three categories of information:
+ Configuration (e.g. how long data should "expire" after)
+ Known data collections
+ Known data sources

Each of these categories can be represented with a TOML table, and so the
=Inventory.toml= has the following structure:

#+begin_src toml
inventory_version = 1

[config]
# ...

[collections]
# ...

[sources]
# ...
#+end_src

The =config= table simply contains key-value pairs.
