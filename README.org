This is the user-facing entry-point for the skeletal [[https://github.com/tecosaur/DataToolkitBase.jl][DataToolkitBase]] package and
the set of useful transformers and plugins provided by [[https://github.com/tecosaur/DataToolkitCommon.jl][DataToolkitCommon]], along
with a few trivial niceties.

This aims to provide a foundation for robust data management.

For now, this set of packages around the beta stage of development. No major
changes to the core functionality or structure are anticipated, but small
expansions in the data-CLI functionality and set of transformers and plugins
provided by /DataToolkitCommon/ are expected prior to the 1.0 release, and larger
changes may occur if there is good reason for them.
