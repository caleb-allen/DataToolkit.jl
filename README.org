This is the user-facing entry-point for the skeletal [[https://github.com/tecosaur/DataToolkitBase.jl][DataToolkitBase]] package and
the set of useful transformers and plugins provided by [[https://github.com/tecosaur/DataToolkitCommon.jl][DataToolkitCommon]], along
with a few trivial niceties.

This aims to provide a foundation for robust data management.

For now, this set of packages around the alpha stage of development. No major
changes to the core functionality or structure are anticipated, but an expansion
in the data-CLI functionality and set of transformers and plugins provided by
/DataToolkitCommon/ is wanted prior to the formal initial release.
